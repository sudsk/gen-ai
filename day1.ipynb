Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",
